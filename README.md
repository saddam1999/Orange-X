# Orange-X
orange x is a copier/backup/restore utility program written in powershell. Unlike orange, its predecessor, orange x is written to be used entirely without the keyboard. It implements Microsoft Speech Recognition Engine and System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer API to run commands. This program script can be of help to the physically challenged simply by issuing vocal commands.
